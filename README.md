# Minmial Strangeness Maximal Relevance Minimal Redundancy method.

We provide the novel MinStra_MaxRel_MinRed (MS_mRMR) feature selection method.
*MS_mRMR*  is the first feature selection method that mixed the concept of strangeness minimization [2] of the Conformal Prediction framework [1] with the feature selection based on information theory (Mutual information). *MS_mRMR*Â´s objective is minimizing the non-conformity of the features while maximizes the Conditional mutual information. Multiclass classficcation is available.  

We also provide the well known mRMR, JMI and relaxMRMR methods implemented in a fast way. The MI estimation is an adapted version of the provided by ...
